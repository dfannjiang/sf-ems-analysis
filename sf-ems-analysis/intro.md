# SF EMS Analysis

This project aims to explore how San Francisco's Department of Emergency Management (DEM)
and Fire Department (FD) responds to medical 911 calls and how they can improve.

Roadmap:

1. (see below) Analysis of response times to medical 911 calls in SF.
2. (TBA) Forecasting medical 911 calls to inform resource needs using machine learning + traditional statistical models.
3. (TBA) Simulating medical 911 calls to test potential operational improvements.
4. (TBA) Reallocating ambulances optimally using reinforcement learning.
